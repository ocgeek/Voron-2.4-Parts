## Filament

I use premium ABS from a well know European supplier [3DJake Nice ABS](https://www.3djake.it/3djake/niceabs-black)
This is what i use for myself and i print parts with

The Accent colours are nice and vivid (more than e.g. eSun ABS which tend to be a bit washed out IMHO) and they are consistent in colour
Also the accent colours are RAL code referenced

3D Jake NiceABS comes in different colours:
- **Black** (matte real Black) RAL 9017
- **Yellow** RAL 1023
- **Orange** RAL 2008
- **Red** RAL 3020
- **Blue** RAL 5002 (my favourite)
- **Green** RAL 6018
- **Bronze** RAL 1036
- ...

## Print Settings

It's worth nothing to say that obviously all parts are printed according to Voron design specifications (4 Perimeters, 40% Infill, 5 Solid layers top and bottom)

## Printed Parts Pictures

I uploaded some pictures of [printed parts in here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/cVB4ZQonY7XALUsVA)



**Note** I'm not part nor affiliated with PIF program...
..though i did print all the parts for my own two Voron 2.4-300 printers i now own and a good number of which i did created myself with Fusion360. 
I contributed to make the Kiicky probe a better probe by amending the design of the dock and the probe itself, i amended the parts for the Planetary Z-Drives..
...so my parts may occasionaly have minor aesthetical imperfections (though they look good) but my printers are still into one piece :)
