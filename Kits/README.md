## Filament

I use premium ABS from a well know European supplier [3DJake Nice ABS](https://www.3djake.it/3djake/niceabs-black)
This is what i use for myself and i print parts with

The Accent colours are nice and vivid (more than e.g. eSun ABS which tend to be a bit washed out IMHO) and they are consistent in colour
Also the accent colours are RAL code referenced

3D Jake NiceABS comes in (a nice matte) Black (main colour), Yellow, Green, Red, Orange and Blue (my favourite) 

## Print Settings

It's worth nothing to say that obviously all parts are printed according to Voron settings

**Note** I'm not part nor affiliated with PIF program...
..though i did print all the parts for the two Voron 2.4-300 printers i now own and a good number of which i did created myself with Fusion360. 
I contributed to make the Kiicky probe a better probe by amended the dock and the probe itself, i amended the parts for the Planetary Z-Drives..
...so my parts may not be aesthetical perfection (though they look good) but my printers are still into one piece :)
