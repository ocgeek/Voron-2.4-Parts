# Complementary Enclosure kit

This KIT is complementary to the functional KIT.
By definition those include parts which are not strictly required for the printer to work however some are likely reccomended 

The Enclosure Kits includes:
- Clips for the panels
- Two large Handles with under panel reinforcements
- Door mounts with M3 screw hinges and magnets 

In more details please see herafter a list of the parts 
The enclosure parts listed are tuned on my own panels and foam stripes thickness (i use 4mm thick policarbonate panels with 3mm thick foam)
Different thickness are possible.
